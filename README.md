I will utilize VBA Scripting to analyze real stock market data. I created a script that will loop through all the sheets and take the following info:

   -Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

   -The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

   -The total Volume of the stock

   -Ticker symbol
